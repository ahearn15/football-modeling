Follow these steps to create your preview:

1. Carefully analyze the provided data for both teams. Focus on their offensive and defensive statistics, rankings, and any standout metrics.

2. Identify the key strengths and weaknesses of each team based on their stats. Pay attention to metrics such as EPA (Expected Points Added) per play, success rates, yards per play, and rankings in various categories.

3. Compare the teams' offensive capabilities against each other's defensive capabilities. Look for potential mismatches or areas where one team might have a significant advantage.

4. Note any particularly impressive or concerning statistics, especially those where a team ranks very high or very low nationally.

5. Based on your analysis, create a detailed preview of the game. Your preview should include:
   - An overview of each team's offensive and defensive strengths
   - Potential key matchups or areas of advantage for each team
   - Any standout players or units based on the statistics
   - How each team's strengths might exploit the other's weaknesses

    prompt = f"""You are an advanced sports betting analyst tasked with providing value picks for an upcoming college football game between the {away} and the {home}.
    You will be given comprehensive game data and analysis in a structured format. Your job is to analyze this information, identify potential market inefficiencies, and provide picks for the Moneyline, Spread, and Total (Over/Under) bets.

The game data is divided into three main sections: Quantitative Analysis, Qualitative Analysis, and Game Odds. Here is the game data:

<game_data>
[Qualitative Analysis]
{main_qual_analysis}

[Quantitative Analysis]
{quant_analysis}

[Game Odds]
{game_odds}
</game_data>

Carefully analyze all the information provided in each section of the game data. Pay special attention to the Quantitative Analysis section, which contains crucial statistical data. Your primary goal is to identify potential inefficiencies in the betting market and find value picks.

When analyzing the data, focus on:

1. Qualitative Analysis:
- Recent performance and trends for both teams, both straight up and against the spread
- Each team's strength of schedule to date
- Coaching strategies and potential adjustments
- Key player matchups and standout performances
- Environmental and contextual factors (e.g., weather, injuries, travel considerations)
- Historical performance in similar situations
- Fan and media sentiment
- Special teams and potential X-factors

2. Quantitative Analysis:
- Team rankings in key statistical categories (e.g., total EPA, EPA per play, success rates)
- Offensive and defensive efficiency metrics
- Specific strengths and weaknesses for each team revealed by the data (e.g., passing vs. rushing performance)
- Comparative analysis of both teams' statistical profiles
- Consider how each team's strength of schedule might conflate these metrics

Note: Remember that basic statistical edges are likely already factored into the odds. Look for complex interactions or recent trends that might not be fully captured by widely available metrics.

3. Market Efficiency Considerations:
- Betting markets are extremely efficient and quickly incorporate most publicly available information.
- Be highly skeptical of any perceived edges. Most obvious advantages or disadvantages for either team are already reflected in the odds.
- Look for hidden value that might not be fully accounted for in the odds, such as:
  * Subtle changes in team dynamics or strategy that haven't received much media attention
  * Complex interactions between multiple factors that might be overlooked in simpler analyses
  * Potential overreactions or underreactions by the market to recent events
- Consider how sharp money (professional bettors) might be influencing the lines

Provide an equal amount of analysis supporting both the favorite and the underdog, as well as both the over and the under. Only after presenting both sides should you make your final recommendation. Strive for true objectivity in your analysis.

Begin by providing a brief summary of the key points across all sections, emphasizing the most significant quantitative findings, and your overall assessment of the game. Then, for each bet type (Moneyline, Spread, and Total), provide your analysis, pick (if any), and a detailed justification for your choice. Consider all relevant factors from the game data, ensuring you integrate both quantitative and qualitative insights.

When making your picks, keep the following principles in mind:
1. Market Efficiency: Assume that the betting markets are nearly perfect in their efficiency. Only suggest bets when you have identified a significant inefficiency that you are highly confident the market has overlooked or undervalued. 
2. Burden of Proof: The burden is on you to prove why your identified edge isn't already priced in. For every potential bet, explicitly state why you believe this particular insight or angle has been missed by the market.
3. Unit System: Rate each betting suggestion on a scale of 0 (no bet) to 5 (max bet) units. A rating of 0 means no bet is recommended, while a rating of 5 suggests a maximum bet within the bettor's predetermined unit system. Assume 1 unit is equal to 1% of the bettor's bankroll. Consider using the Kelly Criterion for optimal bet sizing.
4. Only suggest bets where you believe there is a clear edge based on the data provided. Avoid making bets based on gut feelings or subjective opinions.
5. Only bet on the Moneyline if the line is between -200 and +200. If the line is outside this range, consider betting on the spread instead.
6. Choose either to bet the Spread or the Moneyline, not both, based on which offers the better value proposition according to your analysis. If you choose to bet on moneyline, list "no bet" for the spread and vice versa.

Present your analysis and picks in the following JSON format:

Ensure that your reasoning is clear, logical, and well-supported by the provided game data. Your picks should reflect a careful consideration of all available information, with a focus on identifying and exploiting market inefficiencies. Be prepared to recommend "No Bet" if you don't find any significant edge in any market. Thoroughly justify any betting suggestion with clear reasoning on why the edge is significant enough to warrant a bet, and explain how you arrived at your unit rating.

If you find any areas where the analysis might be incomplete or where you have differing opinions based on your knowledge, please mention these in your summary or relevant betting analysis sections.

Remember, the goal is to make the most accurate and profitable picks based on the data provided, while being extremely mindful of market efficiency. It's entirely acceptable to recommend no bets if you can't identify any clear, significant edges that you're confident the market has missed or undervalued. Quality of analysis is far more important than quantity of bets suggested.

Here are the analyses from multiple expert agents:
 <expert_data>
{expert_data}
</expert_data>

 Each expert has given their insights and picks on the Moneyline, Spread, and Total markets for this game. Your task is to synthesize these opinions and provide a consensus recommendation for each market.
For each betting market (Moneyline, Spread, and Total), please:

1. Tally the experts' picks and determine the most common recommendation.
2. If there's no clear consensus, choose "No Bet" as the recommendation.
3. Summarize the most frequently mentioned factors that experts used to support their picks.
4. Calculate the average unit rating based on the experts' recommendations, rounding to the nearest 0.5 unit. If the average is below 0.5, use 0 (No Bet).

Important: Do not recommend bets on both the Moneyline and Spread. Choose the one that offers better value according to the expert opinions. If you choose to bet on the Moneyline, list "No Bet" for the Spread and vice versa.

def format_for_discord(consensus_pick, home, away, gametime):
    prompt = f"""
    You are tasked with converting sports prediction data into a concise, engaging, and authoritative message for a Discord channel. The data contains analysis and official picks for various betting options in an upcoming college football game. This information comes from an ensemble of highly sophisticated, cutting-edge AI agents who were given data on advanced stats and qualitative factors influencing the game.
    Here is the prediction data to process:
<prediction_data>
{consensus_pick}
</prediction_data>

The game is set to kick off at {gametime}. 

Follow these steps to create the Discord message:

1. Start with a header that includes the team names, using alarm emojis (üö®) on either side. For example: üö®{home} vs {away}üö®.
2. Directly below the header, include the scheduled kickoff time. Example: "üïí{gametime}".

2. For each betting option (Moneyline, Spread, Total):
   a. Use an appropriate emoji (üí∞ for Moneyline, üèà for Spread, üî¢ for Total).
   b. State the official pick and units (if applicable).
   c. Provide a handful key points from the summary or reasoning, using bullet points (-). Focus on analytical depth rather than specific probabilities. Each point should clearly reinforce the bet.
   d. Where applicable, cite advanced analytics metrics (e.g., DVOA, EPA, Success Rate, YAC, etc.) to support each point, explaining how they specifically relate to the bet.

3. Include an "AI Expert Consensus" section (üí°) with 3-4 detailed bullet points summarizing the overall AI panel opinions. Each point should:
   a. Directly support the bet(s) we chose to make.
   b. Highlight a specific aspect of the AI agent analysis used.
   c. Explain how this analysis directly led to or supports the betting recommendations.

4. Use emojis sparingly to enhance readability without cluttering the message.

Key Considerations:
- Ensure the message is easy to read at a glance, highlighting the most important information for each betting option. 
- Return only the formatted message without any additional text or context.
- Refer to the AI panel as "expert AI agents"
- Avoid mentioning specific probabilities or percentages for betting outcomes. Instead, use qualitative terms to express confidence levels (e.g., "strong conviction", "moderate confidence", "slight edge").
- When citing advanced analytics, briefly explain their significance if it's not immediately obvious. 
- Don't make any reference to "real-time" data. Assume all data is real-time.
- Don't add anything about betting responsibly - our users already know that. Focus solely on the analysis and recommendations.
- Make sure your response is under 2000 characters.
